title: About me
---
I received a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience from Paris Descartes University in 2016 and I'm travelling the world ever since. Currently, I'm based in Daejeon, South Korea. 

As a scientist, I'm mainly interested in the way our brain predicts the positive and negative consequences of our actions and how these predictions affect our behaviour. As a civilian, my interests range from data analytics to philosophy, with frequent incursions into Python programming, critical thinking and video games.
